### verbatim

The verbatim environment is used to display LaTeX commands instead of having them executed.

To display a whole block, we can use \begin{verbatim} to open the environment and \end{verbatim} to close it.

### framed
The framed environment  provides an easy way to box a paragraph within a document:
(you will need to include the framed package to use it)

<pre><code>
\usepackage{framed}
% ...

\begin{framed}
This is an easy way to box text within a document!
\end{framed}
</code></pre>
